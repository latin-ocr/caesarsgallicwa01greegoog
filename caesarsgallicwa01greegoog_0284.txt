nominally to assist the tribunes. After this time, we find the
legatus as the regular commander of a legion, with the six tribunes
under him. On this occasion he appointed his quartermaster
(quaestor) to that one of the six legions which was intended to be ,
under his own special command. — praefecit: Et. 256.
