provinces, Cisalpine and Transalpine. Cisalpine Gaul was
the northern portion os Italy, which had been several cen-
turics earlier occupied by invaders from Gaul proper, and
which was not yet reckoned as politicallya partos Italy: it
was a wealthy, populous and orderly country, the procon-
sul’s main dependence lor troops and supplieS, and his
regular winter residence. 'l'ransalpine or Narbonnese Gaul
received its name from its capital, the Roman colony Narbo
It contained some thriving cities and pcacelul districts 3 but
it had as a whole been only recently brought under the
authority of Rome, and was still essentially a foreign coun-
try. It compriscd the whole coast ol the Mediterranean,
from the Pyrenees to the Alps, its northern boundary being
an irregular 'and uncertain line, separating the conquered
nations of Gaul frorn those which were still free. To these
two provinces was attached Illyricum, which was a source
os strength, but did not receive much of his attention.

The authority ol the govemor‘over his province was that
ol a military commander, who was not amenable to the laws
which protected the citizens of Rome. A few privileged citios
or nations, as the old Greek city Massilia, and the allicd
tribe ol the AEdui (after they were brought within the limits
os the empire), were wholly exempted from his authority 3
but all other parts os the province, even Roman colonies like
Narb0, were liable to tribute, and more or less under the
jurisdiction of the governor. Each vprovince had its financial ,

officer, or quaestor, who ranked next the governor himself : ι

the commander was likewise attended by stall-officers, legali
(usually three in number), appointed by the Senate from
persons of rank and position 3 and by an indefinite number
of aids, contzrbernales or comites, who composed what was
sometimes, but inconectly, called the praetorian cohort ΙΑ
consular army consisted regularly ol two legions (at this time

of from 3,ooo to 3,6oo men) 3 to these were added auxiliaries,
