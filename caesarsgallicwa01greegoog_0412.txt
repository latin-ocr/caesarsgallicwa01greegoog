researches was a very striking corroboration of Caesar's narrative.

Cnoste οῖ THE Canentem—If Caesar was merciless in war, he was
wise and humane in victory. Even in the moment of the fall of Alesia, he
uses his prisoners to make terms with the more important states (si per
eos,&c.). His aim was “ not to enslave the Gauls, but to incorporate
them in the Empire3 to extend the privileges of Roman citizens among
them, and among all the undegenerate races of the European provinces.
He punished no one. He was gracious and considerate to all, and he so
impressed the central tribes by his judgment and his moderation, that they
served him faithfully in all his coming troubles, and never more, even in
the severest temptation, made an effort to recover their independence.” *

Caesar’s own narrative closes with the great and decisive victory at
Alesia. ΤΙιε short remainder of the story is told by his faithful officer and
friend, Hirtius Pansa, in the Eighth Book. A rising of the Carnutes and
Bituriges in the west, undeterred by the fate of Avaricum, was crushed by a
rapid winter march across the Loire. The Remi in the north, who alone of
the Gauls had been steadily true to Rome, were attached in retaliation by the
Bellovaci under Commius, but were crushed in a single battle, and Commius
fled to Germany. The final rally of the patriot party was made at the
stronghold of Uxellodunum, on a branch of the Garonne, in the south·
ι west3 but this was also reduced by a siege of extreme difficulty, and the
one act of vindictive barbarity which stains Caesar's record was inflicted
after its fall by cutting off the hands of the desperate defendens who had
held out to the last for the independence of Gaul. Caesar then “invited
the chiefs of all the tribes to come to him. He spoke to them of the
future which lay open to them as members of a splendid imperial state.
He gave them magnificent presents. He laid no impositione either on the
leaders or their people; and they went to their homes personally devoted
to their conqueror, contented with their condition, and resolved to main·
tain the peace which was now established—a unique experiente in
political history.”

Tite Lectons. —In the operations of this year (52 tac.) Caesar used

the 10 legions with which the previous year saw him provided. Legions
Ι and 111 had been loaned him by Pompey (see note on Bk. VI. Chap. 1⁴).
