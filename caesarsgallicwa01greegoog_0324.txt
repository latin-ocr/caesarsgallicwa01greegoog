THE erssh Cetae-The winter camp (castra hiberna), in its gen·
eral arrangement, resembled the ordinary summer canip. There must
have been the same fortifications and streets. However, the convenience
and comfort ol the men were more regarded than when in the field. In
place of tents (tabernacula, pelles) the winter quarters afforded huts, which
gave better protection against wind and weather. The arms were doubt-
less kept in the huts, and the pack animals in sheds. Then, too, more
raom could be taken than in the field. Iri the present case, Galba saved
labor by appropriating a part of the Gallie buildings without much cere-
mony3 but he proceeded to lay out the usual fortifications (see munili-
ones, Chap. 3¹).
