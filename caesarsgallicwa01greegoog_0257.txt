Ι. 24] Τ lte Helvetz'an War. 37

When within 25 to 50 ft. of the opposing phalanx, the two ranks hurled
their heavy spears in a shower, and immediately drew their short swords
and charged fiercely upon the disordered mass of the foe. The odd nurn-
bers of the frout rank sprang forward to gain room (3 ft. would answer for
marching or for using the spears, but at least 6 ft. would be required to
give space enough for the swords). The even numbers and the entire
second rank followed as a support.

Along the front of the cohort exists now a series of single combats. The
third, fourth, and fifth ranks press close up, to aid their comrades and to
take the place of any tbat fall, and meanwhile throw their spears over the
haads of the combatants among the throng of the enemy behind. The
remaining five ranks of the cohort follow slowly, as a reserve.

ln the meantime the second line is advancing, and, if the enemy do not
at once give way, the first line is withdrawn, and the cohorts of the second
rusb through the intervals and attack with spear and sword. The wearied
first line is now occupied in re·forming and getting breath for a new onset,
which is made after a lapse of from ten to fifteen minutes.

We see that we must imagine the legion in battle as in almost constant
motion. The two lines are burled successively against the enemy, giving
the latter no rest, and wearing them out by the incessant blows of the
cohorts. Τὴε third line, however‚is held in reserve, and is only brought
into action in case the other two prove insufficient to cause the enemy to
break.

The cavalry are drawn up in the rear or on the flanks of the army, ready,
should the hostile array be broken and routed, to plunge into the flying
mass and cut them to pieces.

Tne GALLIC Askar ΑΝΙ) Anus. -Tbe Macedonian phalanx had a front
of about 500 men and a depth of 16. That of the Gauls and Germans was
doubtless of similar form, but of varying numbers. The rnen stood close
together, forming a compact mass The shields of the front rank formed
a vertical wall, and those of the rest were held overhead‚ lapping over
one another like the shingles on a roof, only in the reverse order. It will
be seen that the phalanx depended for its success on the momentum of its
mass However, only those on its outer edges could use their weapons,
while the restwere practicallyirnprisoned in the crowd. Here the Romans
had a great advantage; for, from their open and pliable order of battle,
nearly every man sooner or later was in action. Hence, although they
might be greatly inferior in number, they could bring into use more

swords and spem at a given point thau could their enenies.
