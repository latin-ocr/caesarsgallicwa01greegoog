signification is from the effect oi iore-equites triginta: these
few cavalry would be of no service in an engagement, but only in
pursuit. To chase and cut down the beaten army was considered
an essential partos the battle.

CuAP. 37. expositi, landed.—circiter trecenti: From this
statement we may make a pretty close estimate of the number of
men in a full legion. Caesar tells us that he had 80 transports for
his two legions. By the storin 12 ships were lost. These 12 were
probably transpone, as they were at enchon and hence more ex-
posed to danger. That would leave 68. From the two that were ,
separated from the fleet, about 300 men were landed. At that rate,
in the 68 ships there must have been 10,2oo men. As the legions
were without heavy baggage‚ there would have been no servants
exeepting sor the officers. Allowing for these, and for the number
of officers in the general staff, there would remain not much less
than 5000 men in each legion. We see thus that Gbler's estimate

³ oi 4800, as the normal number in the legion, was not far from the

truth—non ita magno, not very larga- numero: Et. 360.
