TO THE STUDENT.

...000—

As CAESAR, though in many respects a book for advanced stu·
dents, is often the first Latin classic put into the learner's hands,
it may be well to give a few hints as to the method of study.

1. Before beginning to read, the learner should be familiar with
the forms of Inflection‚ the simplet mles of Agreement and Con·
struction of Cases (Grammar, pp. 256, 2573 see Rules 1-10, 14,
21, 26), and the Definitions contained on pages 119-122.

2. In every sentence, hegin by finding ene leading verb wille its
subject, and its direct object if it has one3 and so make the main
thought clear before trying to bring in the subordinate parts.

3. Always look first at the inflerlr'nnal terminalium, so that the
number, case, tense, person, &c.‚ will instantly occur upon seeing a
Latin word. The great fault of most learners is carelessness about

inflections. Itis much better to guess at the meaning of the word '

and know its form, than to neglect the form and he careful of the
meaning.

4. ln the use os Notes‚ it is generally hest not to consult them
till you have fairly tried without their aid3 hut, even if the sen-
tence seems quite clear, never neglect to consult them afterwards. ,
Sometimes they will give you information3 generally they will put
the matter in a new or clearer light.

5. Until you are quite familiar with the Syntax, consult all nn
references to llre Grammar. These at first are more numerous and
elementary; but further on— especially in ‘⁴ Indirect Discourse '³ -
they should he carefully studied‚ with the examples‚ and the more
difficult points explained hy the teacher.

6. Many references at first are to the short Rules for Parsing
(Gramma, pp. 256, 257): it may be well to have most of these
Rules quite familiar before going into the details of Syntax.

7. tasuy, remember that Caesar was a man of action and great
intelligence3 that he always had a plain story to tell, and knew just
what he meant to say. He is often awkward3 he may be crafty‚
unscrupulous, insincere; buthe is never obscure. And one should .
never be satisfied until he sees, or thinks he sees, exactly what his
meaning rs.
