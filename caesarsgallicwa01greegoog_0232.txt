12 Noles .· Ceasar. [B. G.

a few years ago -was only “a geographical expression‚'’ implying
no political sovereignty.

persuadet, prevails on: suadet would be, simply, urgeo—ob-
tinuerat, lead held—amicus, an honorary title given by the ἵ
Roman Senate to friendly powers-ut . . . oocuparet, to lay ἵ
hands on. This clause is the object of persuadet (ξ 331. a;
G. 5463 H. 499.3; for the sequence of tenseS, see ξ 287. ις G.
511.1r.1; Η. 492), which in English would be expressed by the in· ἶ
finitive- regnum, here, not hereditary authority, but persona]
rule: what the Greeks called tyranus-ante, here an adverb; in
English we should say before Irim.

Dumnorigi (dat. after persuadet, p. 4), Dumnorix, a younger ¹
brother, restlesS, ambitiouS, and strongly attached to theold aristot· ζ
racy of the elan: therefore a bitter enemy of the Roman supremacy.
He afterwards headed a desertion of Caesar's cavalry, just before the ,
second invasion of Britain, but was pursued and killed (v. 6).

4. Divitidoi: this AEduan chief was of the order of Druids3 he ’
had been in Rome, where he made the acquaintance of Cicero and Ῐ
other eminent Romans. He was thoroughly impressed with the
power and superiority of the RomanS, and was a faithful friend and ¹
ally of Caesar.

The name is by some thought to be a Druid title. The party of Druids, ¹

represented by Divitiacus and Liscus (chap. 16), was the popular party,
strong especially in the large towns: it was opposed by the old clan feel· l
ing kept up by military or tribal chiefs (principes), such as Orgetorix and ’
Dumnorix. The former, or popular party, was headed by the AEdui; the

latter, or aristocratic‚ by the Sequani and Arverni. 'lhe Druidswerea i

religious or priestly order, jealous of the aristocracy (equites) of the tribe
or elan, which represented what may be called the patriotic or “native· ’
Celtic '³ party (see vi. 12-17). A knowledge of this division helps clear
up many of the events of Caesar's campaigns. Divitiacus wasaname well ,
known at Rome. A later writer gives an interesting picture of the Gallie ³
chief standing and leaning on his shield while he made his appeal before
the senate, declining (as a suppliant) the seat which was in courtesy ,
offered him.
