of Mercury, Mars and Hercules. This is almost the only contra·
diction between these writers, in whose accounts of political and
other institutions there is a striking agreement.

3. ab parvulis, from cln'ldlrood (compare “from a child,”2
Tim. iii. 15)-

129 4. qui . . . permanserunt, strictly, “who are slowest
to outgrow” their boyhood. Compare Tacitus: sera J'rcvenum
venus, eoque inexhausta puberta53 and contrast the premature
debaucheries of the Roman youth.

5. nulla occultatio, like the English there is no hirling.-
rhenonum, ie. reindeer's heila-magna . . ‚nuda (abl. abs),
ie. in battle, where Caesar would chiefly meet them.

Crine. 22. agriculturae: as to this chapter, compare what is
said in the general Introduction to the volume, and in Bk. IV.
Chap. 1, where it is shown that the soil was tiled, not by the
labor of old men, women, or slaveS, but by that of the fighting
men. In other wordS, the Germans were, though “ barbarians,'’ not
(in one sense) a barbarous people.

2. neque quisquam, &c This temporary and shifting occupa·
tion of land, as well as the holding of it by the family or clan
(cognatzonibus), is characteristic of a primitive society. But com-
pare the Introduction, as above-fines proprios, prt'vote boun-
dories, or laudatorem-qui uni coierunt: in the general
gathering for this assignment, each elan must have met by itself,
and been represented by its chief.

3. agricultura: notice the use of the ablative (ξ 2523 G. 4043
H.422. w. 2), here to be rendered “fon''-ne . . . expellant:
this was a flagrant evil in Italy, which Caesar had attempted in his
own consulship to check (by the lex agraria), following the pre·
cedent of the Gracchi. There the potentiores had already succeeded
in ousting the humiliores from their estates and creating enormous
plantations, latifundia, cultivated by slaves, in place of the earlier
peasant freeholds.—cum. . . videat: this looks as if the land
was portioned in equal shares to rich and poor alilre, unless we take
aequari in the sense of a ronatt've present, implying only tendency‚
or opportunity.
