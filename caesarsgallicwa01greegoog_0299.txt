vineae (r 0, Fig. 25). Under shelter of these vineae, too, were posted
bodies of legionaries (cohortes expeditae ²¹⁸) to cover the operations and
resist sorties. Farther in the rear, outside the camp, bivouacked strong
bodies of troops, as additional supports.

4. The strength of the various protections would of course depend on the
power os the enemy's missiles. Usually the rude walls os the vineae were
only os a sort of wattled work.

5. Sometimes towers (turres ambulatoriae) were placed on the agger
(Bk. VII. Chap. 17). In such cases the top of the latter was designed to
be a smooth roadway3 and its height had merely to be enough for the
tower to have sufficient elevation. This was probably a quicker way of
approach, as it saved building a considerable part of the agger‚· but it
was not so convenient for a column of attack. The column would have to

pass over a drawbridge let fall from the tower upon the enemy's wall.
As a mle, the tower accompanied.the construction of the agger at its
side (tt, Fig. 25), and served as a battery to clear the enemy from the
wall, and as a redoubt in the line of approaches.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE AGGER.

6. Fig. 24 gives a longitudinal vertical section of the agger. ab is the
city wall to be attacked. The section of the agger when complete is rep·
resented by a b c esh n a. Of this only a little part, as c eslz n d, can be built
regularly. The portion next to the wall, a b c d, must then be filled pell
mell at the last moment.

7. To begin the regular structure, a line of vineae (g l, Fig. 25) was first
advanced from the depot of material to the point of beginning. About 30
ft. in advance of this point, and at right angles to the line of huts, was
placed a line of plutei, to protect the workmen. Through the gallery
formed by the huts the workmen now carried the material. This was, first
