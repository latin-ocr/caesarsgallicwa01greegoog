THE BAGGAGE-TRAIN.-The heavy baggage (impedimenta) of the
legion was carried by pack animals (jumenta), horses or mules. Wagons
or carts, while occasionally used by the army, were more generally found
only with the sutlers (mercatores), who followed the legions. The light
baggage (sarcinae) was carried by the soldiers.

We may reckon the load of one pach animal at 200 pounds. First of
all were the tents. These were described by Hyginus as square, io ft. on
a side, with a wedge roof. Ten nien could use such a tent. Hyginus
estimates 8 men in a tent, but yet allows 1 to every 10, as {of each con·
tuberninm should always be on guard duty. It seems saie to consider
that the contubernium, or number messing together in a tent, in Caesar's
army, was also 10. Then each centurion had one tent. So a maniple
would need 14 tents for the centurions and a strength of iao men. Allow·
ing 2 for the servants, the entire number would be 16. That would make
48 for a cohort, and 480 fora legion. To this number must be added
those needed by' the six tribunes and their servants, or perhaps 12 more⁴
If tents are allowed also for subcenturions, perhaps we should estimate 30
orbomore. ἵ

The tents were os leather (pelles). The weight os one, including two
upright poles, one ridgepole, and a supply of pegs, must have been at
least 40 pounds. One horse, then, could carry 5 such tents. It seems
more likely, however, that we should estimate one pach animal to each
