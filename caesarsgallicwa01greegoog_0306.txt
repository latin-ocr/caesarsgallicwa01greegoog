For pitching camp there must have been needed a full supply of stakes,
tools, &e As these were for general use, they could not have been
divided among the paclr animals of the cohorte. So we may add one
animal to each cohort for this service. Thus the cohort would have at
least 49 beasts. To each beast should be allowed one servant (calo), who
could attend each to a centurion or contubernium.

The higher officers had, besides at least two riding horses each‚a still
greater number of pack animals. We shall not be far astray if we assign
to each tribune three paclr animals and five servants.

Thus the number of pack horses or mules in the baggage·train of a
legion reaches at least 520.

Ι. ΤΗΕ Conona-sse cohort marched either in column os mam'ples =

or in column os centuries.
1. Τὴε column of maniples (manipulatim) was formed from order of
battle merely by facing to the right (or left). (Figs. 27, 29.) Thus the

maniples were in column, and the two centuries of each maniple were side l

by side. As the depth of the cohort in line of battle was 40 ft, of course
the column of maniples was 40 ft. wide. But this was a loose order.
Allowing each man 3ft., the column could easily have been made only
30 ft. wide. Again, this wide column could have been reduced to half the
width by the right (or left) century of each maniple moving straight on,
and the other falling in its rear. Thus the maniple, instead of 12 ranks
of 10 men, would have had 24 ranks of 5 men each. This last formation
was really a column afcenturies by thestonk.

2. The column cffcenturies proper (centuriatim, ordinatim) was formed ¹
from the order of battle by having the maniple on the right (or left) wing ,

of the cohort march straight forward‚ and the others successively followed
(eigs. 27, 30, 31). Thus the centuries would form a column, the width

of which would be the same as the front of a maniple, 40 ft. (or 36 ft, not i

including the centurion on the flank).
