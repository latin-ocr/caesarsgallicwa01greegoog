The reasons are very strong against placing this action in the low lands
at the confluence os. the Rhine and Mense (Moru) ς among them the great
distance, ruore than 120 miles, hom the place where Caesar actually crossed ἵ
the Rhiue. lt will maire the whole narrative much clearer, to regard this ¹
(with Giiler) as the confluence of the Rhiue and Mosella (Moselle) at ¹
Coblentz, the ancient Confluentes. ln this view the text has been confused
hy the likeuess of the nanres, while Chap. 10 appears to he a note added ¹

perhaps by some geographer.
