vl. 23-28.] Second Passage of tlrc Rhene. 159

3. huius, that familiar to the Romans, viz. western-tntum,
as we should say the end, eastward, where it is lost in the Carpathian
range. lts extent, in a direct line, is stated as 1600 miles. —pro-
cesserit, acceperit: subj. by indir. disc. for perf. indic. See last
note on Chap. 15.

131, Crine. 26. boe: this name seems to have been given
loosely to any large-horned, unsamiliar beust, even to the elephant;
here it is probably the reindeer, which had ancientlyawidescat-
tered range-unum cornu: perhaps the specimen described
had lost a horn3 or, more likely, the expression refers to the long
projection from which both branches spring, instead of growing
independently, like the horns oi an ox. The description oi the horn
might, however, rather suggest the moose or lrish elk.

2ss palmae ramique (bend), branching antlcrs.

CHAP. 2⁷. aloes: this name is undoubtedly elks, but the de·
scription is widely unlike (⁶‘a little bigger than goats Ι ”) and quite
unrecognizable. ll it were correct, the creature would be well ’
entitied to the name “wretched animal''(elendtlu'cr) bestowed upon
itin German—crura . . . habent: the same yarn is told by
Pliny, H. N. viii. 16, 39.

3. cum. See last note on Chap.15.-subruunt, undermine,·
accidunt, cut into. - summa speeies, the surface look.

4. eum. See above.

Crine. 28 uri: this name is generally understood to refer to
the German Uroclrs (the primitive or wild ox, probably buffalr), .
said still to be found in the forests ol Lithuania.* Caesar evi·
dently describes a very different animal, with great spreading horns
like those of a reindeer or moose, but the whole description must
have been derived from a confused account. '

4 ne . . . exceptioni even when caught quite young.

132, 5. ab labris, around tlte rim.

*¹ The buisalo os Eastern Europe, domesticated in Transylvania, where the eows are
vntued sor their milk, is long and rather low in form, with depressed and ilar homs, like

theseos the muskox. -Ι, Η. Α.
