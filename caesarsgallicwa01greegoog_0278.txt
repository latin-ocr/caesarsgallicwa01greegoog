width at the bottom was l that at the top.

4. We think ol a wall mainly as a breastwork behind which soldiers are
sheltered from the fire of the enemy. But it was quite different with the
Romans. They had comparatively little need sor shelter from missiles. ,
What they aimed at mainly was a high position, inaccessible to the enemy,
from which to hurl their spears. The section os such a wall we may consider
practically a rectangle‚ os sufficient height and width. The width should
be enough ior standing firmly, and for moving backward and sorwards to
hurl the javelins. The height should be as great as possible. Of course
this would be linrited by the fact that the earth came from the ditch. The
usual height seems to have been ξ of the upper width os the ditch.
Caesar osten speaks os a ditch 15 ft. wide, and a wall os 10 ft. Τὴε outer

to be a facing of some more tenacious material. For this purpose there
were used sods cut in digging the ditch; also timber and brush. This
last was put up in bundles, in the form that we call sarcines. Vegetius
says that the Romans cut sods 1} it. long, 1 ft. wide, and l ft. thick, for
use in fortifications. With such sods cut from the ditch, ὲ the height os
the wall could be faced, leaving the other hall to be strengthened with
sod cut elsewhere, or with sascincs.

5. The Romans were not always content with this iacing of the outer
slope. When they sought to give the wall especial height, they made it
firmet by embedding in it several lines of fascines parallel to the length.

this purpose steps were made. These were oi brush, or at least strength·
ened with brush.

7¹. It is clear, then, that a Roman camp needed much wood, and also that
the section oi the wall was greater· than the section oi the ditch. The ver-
