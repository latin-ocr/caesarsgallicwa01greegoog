Between the γέννα and the Aaron was a plateau, some 1200 to 1600
ft. high, with rather steep banks. As this plateau approached the town, .
it narrowed to a ridge only about 400 st. wide, with the Aaron on one
side, anda swampybrook, the Vburetla on the other. From the Ye'vtelte
to the rtvre extended a morass. At a distance of about 3⁰0 ft. from the
city wall the ridge was intersected by a sudden depression like a heneti, ¹
, perhaps 50 ft. deep (see Plan VIII. 4). Caesar pitched his camp on the
plateau just back ol the ridge, a little over half a mile stom Avaricum.

Along the ridge, right across the intersecting ravine, he built the agger.
