Boot< Fouuru. - ΒΕ. 55.

Passacu or Tua Ruina-The year uc. 55 appears to ‘have been
marked by a general movement in the migratiou of the German tribes.
An advance, consisting of the two populations Usipetes and Tencteri,
crowded forward by the more powerful Suevi, crossed the lower Rhiue
into northern Gaul. Caesar assumed the defence of the country he had
just conquered, drove them back across the Rhine, followed them up by
an expedition into their own territories, and fully established the suprem-
acy of the Roman arms. Another brief campaign iu Germany two years
later confirmed this success, and the Rhine became the military frontier‚ ζ
recognized for many centurieS, between the Roman ernpire and the barba· ἶ
riau world. lu the common opinion of France it is to this day the natural
bouudary, established, as it were, in perpetuity by the arms of Julius Caesar.

69, Pompeio, crasso (the year 55 1³.c.): the coalition be-
tween Caesar, Pompey and CrassuS, sometimes called the first
Triumvirate‚ had been formed five years before. ln carrying out
the scheme, Caesar held the goverument of Gaul, while the others
took into their own hands this year the whole control of affairs at
horne (see Introd., “Life of Caesar”).-Usipetes, Tencteri, from t

3. centum pagos (see Bk. 1. Chap. 12): there is probably some
confusion here with tlre ancient German institution of the Hundred.

Each hundred seems to have sent 1000 men (singula milia) to the l
army. The term early lost its numerical value, and became a mere
local designation. ——manseruntz Et. 358. ἶ
