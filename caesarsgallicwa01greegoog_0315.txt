The only musinians expressly mentioned by Caesar were the buccinatores
and tubicines. The former seem to have used both bugle and horn3 the
latter, only the trurnpet. The various evolutione ol the legion and its
component parts were regulated by horn and trutnpet, - the orders oi the
commander being first signalled on the former, and then passed along the

signal sor the onset to begin. ln the latter case the commander's standard
(vexillum) was first displayed. This was immediately followed by the

simultaneous blast of horn and trumpet (signum iuba dandum). At this
the soldiers raised the war shout (clamor) and rushed to the charge.
They had previously been advancing at a slow step.

The various divisions os the day, reveilll, noon and tattoo, were

sounded by the bugle (buccinn); each signal being followed, quite likely,
by a martial air played by the assernbled musicians of the army.
