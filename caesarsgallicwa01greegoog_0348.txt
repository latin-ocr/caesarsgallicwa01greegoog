Trrn Lnnnrrvo m Burrum—What is called the First Invasion of
Britain, though it marks an interesting date in history, and gave fresh

stimulus to Roman curiosity and ambition, was in itself an affair os small ¹

account. It was, in fact, only meant for a reconnoissance, or, perhaps, as

opening the way to further schemes. Towards the end of summer, Caesar l

sailed across to the white eliiss of Dover, coasted a few miles towards the
west, and established a camp on the British coast. His cavalry, meanwhile,

had been weatherbound in their transports, and then, after crossing, were ¹
driven back by rough winds without even coming to land. After holding ³

an uneasy and perilous position for about three weeks, he returned to

Gaul, without aecomplishing anything beyond a barren display of hardi·
hood.

[Observe in this sentence, that while Caesar's oetion is given in the
perfect (contendit), his reasons are in the imperfect (intellegebat,

arbitrabatur)3 while the conditional clauses si deficeret, si ,
adisset, are strictly future conditions carried into the past by the η

sequence of tenses, ξ 307. f3 G. 598. R.³; H. 509. rsty-quae
