· BOOK II.

Tua Banornu contrahentem—A league of the Belgian
tribes is reported to Caesar, who moves rapidly to the north, and
accepis the submission of the Remi (1-3). Account of the Belgians
'and their tribes. Caesar advances to the Axona, relieves the siege of
Bibrax, the chief place of the Remi, and establishes a camp, strongly
lortified (4-8). The Belgians attempt to cross the Axona, but are
driven back, and pursued with great slaughter (9-11). Surrender
of the Suessiones and Bellovaci: report of the Nervii, who wait to
give battle across the Sabis (ra-16). Position of the two forces:
the Nervii attack with great fury, and throw the Romans into con-
fusion, which is partly overcome by their admirable discipline
(17-20). After various fortune, the Nervii assault the camp, which
is saved, after a desperate struggle, by the personal address and
courage of Caesar (21-22). Labienus comes up with the tenth
legion, and the tide is turned3 the Nervii are crushed and almost
exterminated (26-28). The Aduatuci: after sundry skirmishes
they sue for peace3 but renewing the fight after their surrender‚
are' subdued, and upwards of 50‚ooo are sold as slaves (29-33).
Meanwhile Crassus secures the submission of the coast population
oi the Veneti, etc.; Gaul appears wholly reduced to peace, and em-
bassies are sent to Caesar even from beyond the Rhine (34, 35).

rumores afferebantur, litterisque item Labieni certior
fiebat, omnes Belgas (quam tertiam esse Galliae par-
tem dixeramus), contra populum Romanum conjurare, 5
obsidesque inter se dare. *²C0njurandi has esse cau·
sas: primum quod vererentur ne, omni pacata Gallia,
ad eos exercitus noster adduceretur ; deinde quod ab
nonnullis Gallis solicitarentur,— partim qui, ut· Ger-
manos diutius in Gallia versari noluerant, ita populi 10
Romani exercitum hiemare atque inveterascere in
Gallia moleste ferebant; 3partim qui, mobilitate et
levitate animi, novis imperiis studebant ; ab nonnullis
