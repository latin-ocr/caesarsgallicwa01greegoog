THE Lamotis—When Caesar came to Genera, in the spring of the
year 58 uc„ he found only one legion stationed in the farther province
(Chap. 7'). This was the roth (Legio X), afterwards so distinguished
for fidelity and courage. As soon as the Helvetians set out through the
territory of the Sequani, Caesar hastened to Hither Gaul, enrolled two new
legions (XI and ΧΗ), and called from their winter quarters the three
(VII, VIII and IX) that were stationed in that province (see Chap. rol).
It was these six legions, together with auxiliaries (both horse and foot),
that composed the army with which the Helvetiaus and the Germane were
conquered.
