4 The Legz'onary.

of wood, covered with leather or with iron plates. In the centre was a
boss (umbo), which was merely a knob designed to strengthen and bind
all together. The shield was about 4 ft. long and 2 ft. wide. Osten it was
curved, so as partially to encircle the body. On the outside was painted
the badge of the cohort, —a wreath, or a winged thunderbolt, for instance.
On the inside was the name of the soldier, with

(pilum) was the characteristic weapon of the ,
legionary. Its entire length was between 6 and 7 ft. The shaft was
of wood, round or square, and was upwards of 4 ft. long. Into this ¹
was fitted the slender iron shank (firrum) of the spear,

‘¹ At the bottom of the shaft was an iron shoe, so that in

 

     

camp, or during a rest on the march, the spear might be
set up in the ground. The weight of the entire weapon
must have been about 9 pounds. In early times the legion-
ary had two pila. In the army of Caesar, however, we have:
reason to believe that each soldier had but one.

Caesar fixed the pay of his legionaries at 225 denarii a
year (about β45). Α day laborer in Rome at that time
earned 4³ of a denarius a day; or, in a year of 300 working
days, just as much as a legionary. Thus the soldier was

⁸ far as they were provided by the state, a deduction from

the pay was made. As provision, each man was allowed per month

4 measures (the measure, modius, = 8.67 litres, or a little over a

Beck) of wheat. The measure may be estimated to be worth at the
ighest ᾖ of a denarius. Thus the amount deducted for food

 

cannot have exceeded 36 denarii a year. However, in the prov· Εἰς. 3.

ments, Moreover‚ the soldier in active service always expected an increase
to his income from booty and from the gifts of his general.
