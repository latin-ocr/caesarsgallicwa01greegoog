least when there appeared no immediate danger of an encounter with the
enemy. The legions were in single column and the cohorts in column of
centuries. Each legion was followed immediately by its baggage, which
thus divided it from the legion next following. The last legion probably
detached a few cohorts to follow the baggage. This detachment would
thus form the rear guard of the whole army.

A column of five legions in this order, with a breadtb of 40 tt, requires
10,25o ft. in length. A sixth legion would need 40 minutes to reach the
’ head of this column so as to engage in battle.
¹« It is clear that if the enemy could make avigorous attack in force on
the head of the column, they would have a good chance to tbrow it into
confusion, and prevent it from properly deploying (see Chap. 17).

b. When near the enemy, if it was not desirable to march in order of
battle, the column was formed as in a, but the baggageftrain of all the
army was assembled. Τὴε greater part of the legions, usually three-fourths
of the entire number, composed the head of the column. Then followed
the baggage. The remaining legions brought up the rear (claudunt
agmen). ln this order the legions could b'e deployed much more rapidly,
and were properly called expeditae (see Chap. 19).

If a legion marching expedita is attached on tbe march (in agmine,
sub sarcinis, in itinere), before being able to meet the enemy, the legion·
aries must pile their personal baggage (sarcinae in acervum canipartan-
tur, sarcinae construnlccr*), draw their shields from their coverings
(legiacenta scutis detrahuntur †), put on their field badges (insignia
accommodantur †), put on belmets (galeae induuntur, galeantur†),
and get their weapons ready (arma expediuntur, legio armatur 1). Of
course time was needed for all this; and this time must be won by the
vanguard.

c. The advance in order of battle (acie instructa) could be made only
for short distances. lt was used only when in the immediate presence of
the enemy, and when the ground was suitable. The order of march of each
legion bas already been described (see Blr. IV. Chap. 14¹). Ἴ

7. The march in retreat was usually in one of two forms: a. The retreat
in column, with baggage massed. b. The retreat in square.

a. The baggage was sent out of camp as soon as possible, under escort
of a detachment of infantry. This body formed the vanguard, and with
them went a detail of centurions and privates to stake out the new camp.
Then followed the main body, the cohorts in column of centun'es.
Finally, at a suitable distance, rnoved the rear guard (agaren novissimum).
