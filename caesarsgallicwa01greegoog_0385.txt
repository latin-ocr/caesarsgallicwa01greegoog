2. videbatur: the subj. is quod. . . obtulerunt. -Ambtortgiz

this object oi Caesar’s special animosity and eager pursuit was never
captured. '

Crine. 43. 3. in eum locum = so close upon Irim. - ut . . . oon-
tenderent, that prisoners who were brought in looked round among
themselves sor Ambiorix, whom theshod just seen in fh'glzt -sup
posing that he must have been taken also—and instited that lte

passcd the bounds of nature in their eagerness. -aummam tellei-
tatem. i.e. the prize offered for his capture.

Crine. 44. more maiorum: the ancient Roman mode of pun-
ishment was to fasten the head in a sort of stocks or pillory (furca),
then flog the person to death, aster which he was beheaded. lt was
an extraordinary sentence to pronounce on a prisoner oi war. Con-
certed resistance (conjuratio) had come to be regarded as a flagrant
crime, and its penalty was more and more bloody as time went
on-as we see in the two succeeding Books (see especially Bk.
VIlI. Cha'ps. 39-44).

2. aqua . . . interdixisset, i.e. bantilred them, forbade them to

return to Gaul.

Tne Limone—At the opening of the campaign oi 53 nc„ Pompey
loaned Caesar two legions (I and III). One new one was raised, which
received the same number (XIV) as the one Caesar had divided (see note
on “The Legions‚” end os Bk. V.), and oi which five cohorts were lost with
Sabinus. Hence the number of legions in Gaul had now reached ten.
