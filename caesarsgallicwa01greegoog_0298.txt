78 Notes .· Coesar. [B. G.

was always begun at a distance from the wall very nearly out of the reach
of missiles. It was then gradually extended in the direction of the point
to be attached, and was at the same time gradually increased in height
until on a level with the top of the walls, or even higher. When this
mound was completed, the storming party moved on its top to the
attack. ι

2. The height was often considerable. Before Avaricum* it was 80 st.‚
and as much before Massilia. The length, of course, depended on the
power of the enemy's missile weapons. It seems probable that those built
in assaulting the Gallic towns were not very long. The least distance from
the hostile wall at which the construction could have been begun was
from 400 to 500 ft. The width above must have been enough for a storm-
ing column, very likely of the usual formation. If we take this to be the
front of a maniple, the least breadth would have been 50 st. ΤῙιε sides
might be quite steep‚ as we shall see later. A fabric 80 ft. high and 50
ft. wide on top, might have been 60 ft. wide on the ground. To the
building of the agger, it must be re-
membered, everything else in the
siege was subordinated.

3. By way of preparation for its
construction, first of all the ground
must be levelled for the foundation.
This could be done by workmen pro·
tected by testudines, stout movable
γ y sheds (a, Fig. 26). Then the work-

and those providing the material,

 

must be guarded from the missiles of the enemy. The former were pro-
tected by pluzei, large standing shields, which could be advanced from time
to time. Τὴε others brought the material in covered galleries, composed of
a series of vineae (sheds like the testudines in Fig. 26, but entirely open at
each end), reaching to the point of beginning the agger. The workmen
were also protected by archers, slingers, and tormenta, drawn up in a line
parallel to the hostile wall. The archers and slingers were themselves
protected by a line of plutei: the tormenta were placed usually in moving
towers (c, Fig. 26). Τὴε toweis were increased in height as they moved
sorward by putting up additional ston'es. Each floor often had an outside
gallery protected by a sort of palisade. These parallels (i.e. the plutei
and towers) must also have had covered approaches of long lines oi
