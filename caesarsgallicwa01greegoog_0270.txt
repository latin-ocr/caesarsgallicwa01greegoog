30 Noas: Ceasar. [Β. G.

We may observe, on this point, that it seemed the uniform policy ol the
Romans that the cohorts, as well as the officers, should differ in rank, in
order that the most experienced and skillsul men might soum the first line,
and those of less experience the last. For the same reason, the best cen·
turions would be needed in the first line, i.e. iu the first four cohorts. The
passage iu Vegetius,* II. 21, we interpret as follows ι -

As vacancies occurred in the ranks os any cohort, they were filled by
detailing the best men from the next lower cohort. Thus recruits would
always fall to the tenth cohort, aud the first cohort would contain the very
flower of ¹the legion. Hence, under ordinary circumstances, when it became
necessary to appoint a centurion, selection would be made from the privates
os the first cohort (presumably stom its first maniple), and he would be
assigned as a centurion of the tenth cohort. Then he would pass suc-
cessively through the grades of that cohort, then through the grades ol
the ninth, and so on, until he became first centurion os the first cohort
(primipilus). Thus the circle (orbem) os service would be complete.

As to the optiones, each centurion seems to have selected his own, as
the word implies‚ and as is expressly stated by Varro, Festus, and Paqlus
Diaconus. This choice would be impossible it they were graded as Go'ler
supposes.

of question, see ᾗ 338. R.; G. 654 R.²; H. 523. ll. N. ς (direct, judicet,

* Nam quasi in orbem quemdam per diversas cohortes et diversas scholas milites pro·

cohortem; et rursus ab ea, crescentibus stipendiis, cum majore gradu per alias recurrit ad
primam.
