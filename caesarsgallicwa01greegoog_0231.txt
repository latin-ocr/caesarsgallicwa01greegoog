Observe that Latin employs different moods sor the two iorms of quota·

tion, one ior what is called Direct and the other ior Indirect Discourse.
Whenever the writer or speaker takes the refflnsihility of the statement,

. it is put in the Indicative, with commands in the imperative. Tbese are

the moods of DraEcr mscouass. When anything is told not simply as a
fact, but that sonte one perceioed, thought, or said so, the leading statement
is put in the Infinitive, and all subordinateparts (including commands) in
the Subjunctive. These are the moods ot rnnrascr urscouasn. The
narrative in this chapter will require a careiul attention to the above dis-
tinction. Lct the learner here study attentively the introductory paragraph

are given in the iorm oi narrative: that is, in indirect Discourse.
