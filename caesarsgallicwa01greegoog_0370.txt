Saconn Passalos oa nnn anna-'l‘he last campaign, including the

bootless return from Britain, and the slaughteros the division ol Sabinus l

nrust have been in the eyes ol the Gauls at least as good as a drawn battle,
and have given them fresh hope in the struggle. The strength ol their
resistance was in the north and east, where they had the support ol raids
from across the Rhine, -a lalling back on barbarism which it was espe-
cially the business oi Caesar to check by a during blow. Hence the policy
of this new, but idle, advance into Germany. It maybe borne in mind
that this campaign was the more critical, as following closely upon the
deleat and destruction of the Roman armies rmder Crassus in the East.

the loss of Cotta and Sabinus, and the sudden revolt led by Indu·

2„ proconsule: Pompey had been consul rac. 55. He was now

nontinally proconsul of Spain, with six legions; but remained in
ltaly, ruling his province through legati. lt was at this time that he
built his great wooden amphitheatre in Rome, capable of holding
3o,ooo spectatura-ad urbem (not in urbe): as long as henas
in military command (cum imperto), he might not enter the city-
which in such case had only been done by Sulla—reipublicae
causa, the superintending of the corn supply (cura annariae).
-Ciaalpina Gallia, Caesar's own province. But Pompey and
Crassus had received authority to raise troops where they pleased,
and in whatever number. The jealousies arising from this transfer
of troops had fatal consequences afterwards-consulis . . . ro-

gavisset: the verb rogare is used of the magistrate who puts a 2

proposed law to vote3 literally, “asks” the people if they will
accept it (jubeatzine?); also os a commander who demands ol his
men whether they will be bound to him by oath. The genitive
(consulis) indicates the magistrate or officer who imposes the oath;

on ‘the part of the soldiers the expression would be, in verba ’

consulis jurare. — juberet follows petit (sc. ut) ς its object being
the antecedent (eos) of quos, above.
