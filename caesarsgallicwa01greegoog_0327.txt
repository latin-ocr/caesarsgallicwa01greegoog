Tua CouJuuenou cum.

in the seveu books De Bello Gallico, Caesar uses cum as a conjunctiora
283 times.

I. In 62 places it is plainly causal (as, since), and iu 13, concessive
(although), and therefore takes the subjunctive (eg. Blr. i. Chap. 2¹. 26².
See 5 326; G. 587-8; H. 515· 111. 5 7).

11. ln the remaining 208 places it is as clearly temporal (acken, while,

aster).

a. 1. In 160 of these it introduces a clause the {atain use of which is to

η define tlte time of a past action, and it is followedby the imperfect or plu·

perfect subjunctive. With the former tense the clause may denote either
a point of time or a period, and the conjunction should be translated roten

ἶ or ruhilerespectively. With the pluperfect the translation may be when

or aster (eg. Bk. 11. Chap. 1¹3 Bk. 1. Chap. 26⁸. See §3253 G. 586; ll.
5²¹· 11. 2). The temporal clause usually expresses an event that actually
happened3 but the subjunctive shows that the writer’s nraiu idea in using
the clause is to indicate by it the tinae of the event expressed by the prin-
cipal statement.

2. Occasionally the clause with cum and the subjunctive is used to chor-
arteriaca period of time, suine form of tempus being expressed or under·
stood (at a tinae ruben, dic). This construction gives us simply a subjunc-
tive of characteristic (eg. Bk. I. Chap. 16. See ξ 320; G. 582. tt. 1, 6343
H. 521. 11. 2. t)); this was without doubt the original meaning of all
subjunctives with oum.

b. As the story of the Gallie war is purely narrative, containing few
direct quotations, and those the briefest, we naturally find no instances of
the use of cum with the future or future perfect indicative. In 13 pas·
suges, however, it occurs iu the indirect (liscourse with a subjunctive that
takes the place of one or the other of these tenses. In such sentences the
