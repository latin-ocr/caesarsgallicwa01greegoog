“The tribes which descended upon Britain had entered Europe
not as a set of savages or wandering pastoral tribes, or mere pirates
and warriors, but as colonistS, who, rude as they may have been in
dress and manners yet, in essential points, were already a civilized
people.” Various considerations, says a recent writer, make it
probable “that the Germans had come down from the northeast
not very long before the Christian era, and intruded themselves,

⁸ as a wedge‚ between those two more anciently recorded nations

(Scythians and Celts). . . . We shall see evidence os the continuous
advanee ofa civilized race from the confines of lndia to these
islands‚ and nothing indicative of a great rush srom the North oi
wild hordes bent upon robbery and destruction, as it has been usu-

Caesar denies this, but the frontier tribes, with whom he was ac· 3

quainted, were living under certain peculiar Mark laws and were, ³
in sact, little else than an army on its march. The unquestionably ἶ
native, and not Latin or Celtic, origin of such names as Beaeh and y

Hawthorn, of Oats and wheat‚ prove that although our ancestry
may have been indebted to the provincials of the empire sor their

fruit-trees, and some other luxurieS, for a knowledge of the fine y
