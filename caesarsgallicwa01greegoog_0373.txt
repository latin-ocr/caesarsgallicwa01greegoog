VI. 4-11·] Second Passage of tlte Rhene. 153

7. comitati eoo, in company with them (the German).-
demonetravimue: see Bk. V. Chap. 3 and 56. Ι

Canu. 9. miserant, sc Germani, implied in trans Rhenum
2. paulum supra, a little above, or to the south, “apparently
near Andernaelt.” -nota ratione = on the plan already tried and

o proved (compare Bk. lV. Chap. ¹7)·

123. 4· purgandi sutizo& ας G.429.R.1; Η. 542· ln. 1.
6. cognita. hovinginquiredinto.

CHAP. 10. lia . . . imperio, subject tribes, not confederata

allies. Tacitus, however (Ger. 38), represents the Suevi as a eon·
iederacy: its subjecte may, after Caesar's time, have been admitted
to alliance. - peditatus, ξ 214. ις G. 3593 H. 396. Vl.

3. penitus, entirely.

4. silvam: this was the natural frontier (pro nono muro) ol
the north German plain towards the south. A range of wooded
hills still borders the Saxon duchies on the north. The Cherusci

held the valleys of the Weser and Scine.

Cane. 11. locum, a “place '' where there is really nothing to
tell, as Caesar found the country deserted (Chap. 29), and returned
at once to Gaul. We owe to this void in the narrative a most
curious and entertaining glimpse into the geographie and ethno-
graphic knowledge ol the time.

124, 2. quorum: the antecedent is principes. The subjunc-
tive redeat indicates the character of their authority (§ 3203 G.
6333 H. 503. l.). Or, by making eorum the antecedent, we should
have the meaning that the party chiess are designated (as in our
political conventions) bya body, or couucil, to whom the decision
is referred by general consent,—a plausible understanding of the
passage.

3. ne quis. correl. with ita (in itaque); the clause ne . . .
egeret being in appos. with ejus rei. and the past tense (egeret)
taking its time from manentum [esse]: ξ 287. ας G. 518. exc.;
H. 495. IV.

4. ratio, order of things.-in summa. in general, the gen.
Galliae depending on ratio.
