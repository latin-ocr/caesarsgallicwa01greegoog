Ramnlva RANK OF THE CENTURIONS.

Tbere were ten classes (ordines) oi centurions in the legion, those ol
each cohort composing one class, and ranking in the order of the cohorts.
The six centurions of the first eohort, then, were the centuriones primorum
ordinum ‚· those of the second cohort, secundorum ordinum, Sco* Usually,
only those of the first class were summoned to the council oi war. But this
was a ‚full council of all the officers, as Caesar desired to make as wide au
impres'sion as possible through the army.

Giiler thinks that the first class comprised the first centurions from all
the cohorts, &e.; thus making six classes ol ten in each class. But Caesar
mentions an eighth class (B. C. 111, 53). ¹So Gh'ler is obliged to assume
that the subcenturions (optiones) were considered centurions, thus making
six more classes.
