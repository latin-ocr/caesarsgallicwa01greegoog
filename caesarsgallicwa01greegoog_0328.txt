temporal clause is equivalent to a protasis (eg. Bk. 1. Chap. 39⁵. See
§ 325- c; G. 5843 H. 507. 3).

c. In 33 passages cum takes the indicative with tenses referring to y
present or past time, and in 2 others, Bk. ll. Chap. 4, Bk. Vl. Chap. 25,
the subjunctive iu indirect discourse equivalent to the historica} perfect
indicative. ibe mood shows that the writer-’s main idea in using the
temporal clause is to emphasize the reality ol the event expressed by it,
and that the temporal relation is of secondary importance. We distin· ¹
guish several varieties of usage.

1. ln 21 sentences the verb in the temporal clause denotes a repeated
action. Cum here is equivalent to quotiescumque (whettever, as osten as),
and the clause is really the protasis of a general conditional sentence (eg. ,
Bk. l. 1³. IV. 33¹. ΙΙΙ. 14⁶. See §5 322, 309. c; G. 568-9, 5853 H. 471·3
and 5; Madvig, 335, Obs. 1. 359).

2. ln 8 sentences oum is used as the correlative ol tum, in the sense ol
both . . . anot. The indicative ol a verb expressed or implied is used in ’
both clauses, unless in indirect discourse (eg. Bk. V. Chap. 4³. See ξ 326.

b; G. 5893 H. 521. nl).

3. In 3 places (Bk. VI. Chap. 71 and Chap. 81, Bk.VII. Chap. 26³)
the clause with cumis really the main proposition (see Madvig, 358. Obs.

t ; § 325. b; G. 581. R.); this is the so·called cum inversum, by which the
clause of time with the indicative (as in c above) is made the principal
proposition in form. And in one other place (Bk. I. Chap. 40⁴) it is t
really a coordinata clause, eum being equivalent to et tum.

4. In the remaining 2 passages (Bk. III. Chap. 9, Bk. Vl. Chap. 12)
the indicative is used with eum merely to ernphasize the realityos a
siniple past action.

2. in se admisissent, trad taken on themselves: admitto alone
is the ordinary phrase for contnn't. -legatos . . . conjectos (the
specilic act), in appos. with facinus.

58 3. pedestria itinera, dre, approactes by laudavere cut off.
—insoientiam i.e. the Romans' lacl( of acquaintance—neque
. . . confidebant, and they trusted tltat our arnrr'es could not, &c

4. ut . . . acciderent (concessive, ἓ 266.c; G. ⁶¹03 H. 515. Ill).
grantt'ng tlrat everytlting should turn ont contrary to their expecta·
tion. -plurimum posse. were strongest. - facultatem, supply. -
longe aliam . . . atque, arry defferent . . . from-concluso,

t enclosed (like the Mediterranean).
