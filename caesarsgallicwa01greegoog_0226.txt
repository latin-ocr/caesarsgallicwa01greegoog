HELVETIAN wan—Early in the year 58 B.c., the whole population of
Helvetia (northern Switzerland), amounting to about 360,000‚ attempted to
pass by an armed emigration through the heart of Gaul, in order to settle
somewhere near the shore of the Bay of Biscay‚ possibly with the hope of
being masters of the whole country. They were hemmed in by the great
natural barriers of the Alps, the Lake of Geneva, and the Jura Mountains
on the south and west; and pressed on the north by great hordes of
Germans, who kept up a continual border war. Their tields were scant,
their harvests insufficient, their people hardy and fearless. Their ambitious
chief, Orgetorix, had prepared them so well for this enterprise, that his
flight and death-when he was charged with guilty conspiracy, and put
on trial for his life —caused no delay. The attempt was held in check by
Caesar, during a fortnight’s parley, till sufficient earthworks had been thrown
up along the Rhone to withstand their advance; the advance was then
made in force along the narrow pass between that river and the Jura. But
the Helvetians did not succeed in getting more than fifty miles beyond the 3
frontier, when they were overtaken by Caesar; who, by a few light skirm· ¹
ishes and two bloody battles, forced thern back to their own territorias, with
the loss of more than 200,000 lives. This brief campaign, lasting only froin
March to June, is called the Helvetian War.
