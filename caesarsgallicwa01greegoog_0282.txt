11. In the middle of the iront wall was the porro praetorio, and opposite,
in the rear wall, was the porto decumana.

12. From the porta praetoria to the vio principalis extendeda street, the
oia praetorio. Opposite this, in the middle part of the camp, was the
praetorium, a wide space in which were the headquarters tents, the altars,
ancl the tribunal. This space occupied in length all the middle of the
camp, but extended only 100 or 150 st. each side oi the middle line.

13. In the retentura was a similar place, the quaestorium. Here were
the quarters os the adrninistrative staff, here hostages and prisoners were
kept and forage and booty were placed.

14. Outside of the camp, back oi the porto decumano, were the booths of
the sutlers (mercatores) who followed the army.

15. ln the praetentum were stationed from ᾗ to ὲ of the cohorts, equally
divided between the two sides* They occupied the tents sacing the wall.
Also in the praetentum, along the vio principalis, was the place for the
tents of the legati and tribuni militum. Again, in each half of the proe-
tenturo, in the space enclosed by the cohorts along the wall, by the tents
of the legati ancl tribuni and by the via princepalis, were encamped ξ of
⁴the cavalry and ὲ of the archers aud slingers. Thus in the entire praeten-
turo were quartered h of the cavalry 3ηά 311 the archers and slingers,
ready to march from the sront gate and form the advanced guard.

16. On each flank of the mid coorp, next the wall, was aline of cohorts, 1¹6
os the entire number in the army. Thus ἑ oi the cohorts were here quar·
tered. Next the praetorium, along both its longer sides, were placed the
staff, except, ol course, the legati and tribuni. Along the vio principalis,
between the cohorts along the wall and the staff, were encamped on each
side l oi the cavalry, or ὲ in the whole mid-camp.

17. ln the rear part of the camp, on each sicle of the quaestorium and
equally divided by it, lay the rest of the cohorts, about l of all in the army.
They laced the wall on the flanks and rear. Enclosed by the cavalry, by
the quaestorium, and by the vio quintana, was the place ‘sor the auxiliary
infantry, excepting the archers and slingers.

18. Entirely around the camp, within the wall, extended a broad
street. This would at once prevent the likelibood of hostile missiles
reaching the tems, and would allow room lor moving troops 'to defend
the walls. The width of this street is variouslyestimated. It was probably
over 100 ft.

19. ln the spaces behind the tents the arms were staclred and the paek
animals tethered.
