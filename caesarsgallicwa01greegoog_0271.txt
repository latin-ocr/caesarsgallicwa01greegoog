1. 4o.] Campaign against Ariovistus. 51

videbatur: although this clause was a part of Caesar's speech to
his officers‚ yet the indicative is used t0 emphasize to the reader
the reality of the fact it asserts (ἓ 336. b; Η. 529. tal 2)). lt will
be noticed that eum is here equivalent to et tum. and the appar·
ent temporal clause is actually codrdinate with the preceding
infinitiva. This is the only instance in the Commentaries of an
imperfect indicative with euna-meritus, sc. esee-servili tu·
multu (abl. of time), the insurrection oi the slaves (gladiators)
under Spartacus, sc. 73-71. These consisted largely of the Ger·
mans captured by Marius. A war at home, ie. in ltaly oron its
borderS, was called tumultus (see Cic. Phil. viii. 1). -quoe (reler-
ring to servos implied in servili) . . . sublevarent (changing to
passive so as to keep the emphasis), wba yet were consederably
helped by tlte trainrng and desceplr'ne wbr'cb tltey bad got fram us.
