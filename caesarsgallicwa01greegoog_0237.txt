THE Roman Lucium—Tbe normal strength ol the legion has been vari·
ously estimated up to 6000 men. We have reason to believe that in
Caesar’s army it did not exceed 5000 (see note on Bk. IV. Chap. 37). As
toa lar more important fact, the‘actual strength in the field, we are much
better informed. It seems quite clear that the average field strength of
Caesar’s legion did not vary lar from about 3600 men; and that number
we will consider the basis oi our estimares. This legion, or brigade, as we
should perhaps call it, was divided into 10 cohorts, or‘small battalions, oi
about 360 men each. The cohort consisted ol 3maniples or companies,
about 120 strong. As the cohort was the tactical unit oi the legion, 5ο

the maniple was the tactical unit of the cohart. Each oi these military
uuits contained lrom day to day essentially the same men, under the same
officers. The maniple, however, was divided, on a different principle, into
tivo equal parts, called ordines, or centuriae (centuries). When the men
lell in ior morning roll-call, for instance, the maniple was formed accord·
ing to height. The taller soldiers would thus form the first ardo, the rest,
the second. Thus some men might οο0 day be in one orda, and another
day in the other, as on successive days different squads might be detailed
iram the maniple lor guard duty or other special service. The ardo cor-
responded exactly to the platoon in an American company.

The officers oi the legion were the tribunes (tribuni militum) and the
centurione (centuriones). Oi the former, each legion had six, who had
charge in turn, two at a time. Tbey did not command the legion in battle
unless specially detailed for that purpose. Their duties were what is called
administrative, i.e. having io do with the levying and discharge, the
cquipment and supplies ol the troops; and judicial, ie. they tried and
punished offenders against military law. Of the centurions, the real
leaders os the legion, there were two to each maniple. The senior (prior)
