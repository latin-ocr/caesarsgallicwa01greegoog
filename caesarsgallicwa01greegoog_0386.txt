WAR oF VERCINGETOR1x.-The last three campaigns had been con-
ducted wholly in the north, with a view either to crush the bolder and
more restless northern populations, or to overawe the more barbarous J
Britons' and Germans beyond the frontier. lt is not quite clear why the y
discontented spirits of the south did not seize the occasion to join forces ξ
with the formidable Belgian revolt. Atall events, they seenred quiet and t
submissive after their defeats in the earlier campaigns, and might have ¹
continued so but for the news from Rome, where “ the discomfiture of
Crassus had been more pleasant news to the Senate than the defeat of
Ariovistus3 and the passionate hope of the aristocracy had been for some
opportunity which would enable thern to check Caesar in his career of
conquest, and bring him home to dishonor and perhaps impeachment.'’ -
Fraude.

This opportunity might seem to offer in the disorders which followed
the death of Clodius. Clodius was a bully and professional politician
belonging to the popular party, a bitter enemy of Cicero, whom he had ,
succeeded, a few years before, in driving into exile. He was lrilled in a ¹
street brawl on the aoth of January of this year by Milo, a ruffian of the χ
senatorial or aristocratia party. For the time, all regular and orderly gov- i
ernment was at an end, till at length Pompey was invented with dicta· J
torial powers, and quiet was restored. The news of these events coming
to Gaul, gave the native leaders reasonable ground to hope that a new
uprising might be successful. Their plan, it will appear, was, by a sudden
nrovement, to cut off Caesar’s communications with his military posts in
the north, which would thus be speedily starved into surrender. This plan
Caesar foiled by striking, with his usual rapidity, through their line, and
through the neutral or hostile populations of Central Gaul, and so ad-
vancing upon his assailants with the support of his legions from the north.

His campaign of this year was the most fiercely contested, as well as the
most important and decisive, of the entire war.
