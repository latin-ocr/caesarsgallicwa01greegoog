11. r.] Belgian Consederacy.

Boou secono. -B.C. 57.

THE BELGIAN Communem-The people of Northern Gaul, includ-
ing Flanders and the Netherlands, were far remote from any country hith-
erto occupied by the Roman arms. They lived arnid forests and swamps
hard to penetrate3 they claimed kindred with the German tribes rather than
with the more fickle and effeminate Celts3 and they had a fierce and resolute
spirit of independcnce, like that which the Dutch exhibited long after in the
same regions, against the armies of Spain* The Belgian tribes, and partic·
ularly the Nervii, appear in this confederation to have offered to Caesara
more formidable and desperate resistance than any he met elsewhere, until
the great rising of rac. 52; and when their spirit was once broken, the con·
quest of Gaul was simply a question of time.

dixeramus. The Romans were very precise in indicating the
relation of actions to one another in point of time. When one
must be completed before another begins, the former is almost
invariably expressed by a tense of completed action. Here the
perfect, demonstravimus, implies an act (Bk. 1. Chap. 54) done
before the time of writing; the pluperfect‚ dixeramus, an act
(Bk. Ι. Chap. 1) that took place before the letters and rumors
came. Of course, to the writer the time of writing was present.
and at that time the acts denoted by atterebantur and fiebat
were in the past. Some think that each book of the Commen-
taries was written out at the close of the campaign of which it
treated, from notes taken from day to day-conjurare, uniting
under'oatlz: “any war against Rome is a ⁴ conspiracy'3 a nation
enslaved by Rome is ‘pacified’ ’'
