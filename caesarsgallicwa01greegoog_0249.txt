forests, and draining the marshes which then covered much of
the country.—frumenta‚ the plural is regularly used of standing
grain. —pabuli greenfadder (root in pasco). The crops of grain
(frumenta) were not ripe because it was too early in the season

Caesar was following in the path ol the Helvetians, whose thousands
ol cattle had swept the country bare—frumento, object of uti.—
