embraced the three provinces of Galliis Narbonensis, Gallia
Cisalpina (North Italy), and Illvn'cum. Crassus and Pompey
received no special authority at first, but remained in the
city, ostensibly as private persons, to look after the interests
of the coalition. This was further strengthened by the mar·
riage of Pompey with Caesar’s young and beautiful daughter
Julia„

After two successful campaigns in Gaul, in the spring of
ne. 56 Caesar met his two confederates at Luca, in Etruria
to arrange their future schemes The conference was held
with great display, almost like a royal court. More than
roo senators were present, and 120 lictors were iu attendance,
attached to the several magistrates. At this conference it
was agreed that Pompey and Crassus should hold the con·
sulship the following year, and, after their term of office,
should receive by popular vote a similar command to that
held by Caesar,—uamely, that Pompey should command in
Spain and Crassus in Syria for five years each; also that
when Caesar’s five years were up, he should receive in the
same way a second term of five years. His ten years’
administration would then close at the end of ae. 49 3 after
which time-an interval of ten years having elapsed-he
would be eligible again as consul.

Τὴθ programme was ‘duly carried out Crassus departed
(ac. 54) to his province, where he was defeated the next

title proconsul or propretor, govern one of the military provinces. If the
proconsul was not relieved at the end of the year, his power continued by
the necessity of the case. In one instance, that of Pompey, an extraordi-
nary power was conferred upon the proconsul by act of the people (the
Manilian Law). Regularly, however, the assignment of provinces was
rechoned a part of the administrative powers of the Senate; aud a law of
Caius Gracchus directed that the consular provinces should be determined
before the election,-that is,a year and a half in advance,-and theu
that the consuls should draw lots which to have.
