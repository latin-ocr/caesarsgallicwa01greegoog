. (speculatores). The guard cohorts were probably changed at the tattoo‚
the new guard going on duty now to serve 24 hours. The night sentries

(vzgiles) were at once posted on the tambours (titula) and wall. The ,

night from sunset to sunrise was divided into t'ourequal watches (vigiliae).
Each cohort on guard was divided accordingly into four reliefs, one ol
which should be on duty during each watch. The other three reliess
could rest. Of course, they lay on their arms, ready for duty at a
moment's notice. If the cohort contained only about 300 men, it will
readily be seen that 70 men could compose one relief. This number, for
a length of wall ol 2100 ft. (one side of the camp), would give one ἵ
sentinel t'or each 30 ft. The different reliefs were signalled by the
trumpeters (buccinatores).

At daybreak the rnusicians sounded the revec'lle'. If the march was not ’

to be resumed‚ the guard cohorts drew in their night sentries, and posted
the less numerous sentinels for the day. ΤῙιε cavalry pickets took their
posts (stationes), and sent out their scouts (exploratores). At noon this
cavalry guard was relieved.

During the night the rounds of the sentries were probably made by the
centurions of the guard. Occasionally, also, the tribunes on duty, and the
general himself, would inspect the guards, to make sure of the vigilance
with which the camp was watched.

Is camp should be made in the presence os au enemy in force, the usual
vanguard would not be enough to cover the operation. One or two
legions would then be deployed in triple line os battle. The first two
lines would keep off the enemy, and the third would do the work of
fortilying.*

The army might leave the camp either to attack a near enemy, or to
continue the march.

ln the first case the tents were left standing, the baggage remained in its
place, and a'guard was left in charge. This guard might cousist osa
detail from each legion, or ol entire legions. The latter would be likely
to occur when legions of raw recruits were present. These would natur·
ally be left within the walls.†

In case of continuing the march, the camp was abandoned. at
the first signal of the bugles (regnum profectionis), the tents were
struck ; at the second (vasa conclamaretur), they and the rest os the
baggage were packed on the beasts; at the third, the march began.
To conceal the departure from the enemy, the signals might be omitted.
Still it was deerned a point os military honor to sound them.
