of all, logs 20 to 30 ft. long and from a foot to a foot and a half
thick. These were piled in layers alternating in direction, “cob house ’'
sasbion (Fig. 23). In the middle was left a passage some 10 or 12 ft.
wides The interstices were filled with stones,
sods‚ brush, ἃς. When the work had reached
a height of about 7 ft., a layer of timbers was
placed entirely across it, thus at the same time
covering over the passage and making a floor
for a second story. Thus the first story was
completed to a length os 30 ft. The plutei
[fik-³¹ -- were now moved 30 st. abead, and, in like
manner as before, a second section of the
agger was built. The covered passage through
the first Section served the same purpose as
the line of vineae, for the protection of those
carrying the material. At the point of begin-
ning, steps were made so as to reach the top
of the first story.

story and across it; and under their protection
a second story was begun, just like the first. At the beginning of this,
room was left for a platform (fg) by which to approach the covered

gallery (n) of the second story. In this manner the work was steadily
advanced, until the entire structure

thrown out into the remaining space,

until it is quite filled. The sides of the regular structure were protected
from fire by being covered with fresh hides. When the agger was brought
quite to the wall, the time for assault had arrived. Archers, slingers and
tormenta swept the wall with missiles, while the column of attack mounted
