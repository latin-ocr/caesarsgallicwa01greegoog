It was the duty os these last to delay the enemy, thus giving the army time
to push on, or to deploy, if the attaclc should be made in force. The rear
guard was usually composed os cavalry, with archers and slingers.*

b. The retreat in square was chosen when the enemy were on all sides;
ior instance, on a march through a rebellious country, and also when the
hostile cavalry were numerous. Α single square could be formed srom all
the legions, with all the baggage of the army in the centre; or each legion
could form a square by itsels, with its baggage enclosed. The cavalry,
supported by the archers and slingers, remained without as skirmishers.†

8. Flank marches were made only fora short distance, and always in
order ol' battle. The legions marched in column of lines, so that there
were two or three parallel columns, according to the formation. The
baggage-train would either march on the side remote from· the enemy, or
between the legions, each being followed by its own pack animala. The
latter mode might be used when the army was divided from the enemy by
some considerable obstacle, lilre a river, or when the side remote from the
enemy was difficult to traverse; lor instance, when the army was marching
in the valley of a stream, so that the water was on the flank towards the
enemy, and hills and woods on the other flanhss ln such case as last
mentioned, no guard of light troops would be necessary between the army
and the enemy. But in open ground, such a detachment would have to
be made, and would cover the march as slrirmishers To form line of
battle from a column os march by the flanlr‚ was a simple nralter unless the
baggage was between the legions. lt was done by facing to the right or
lest, as the case might be. In every march os a large body of troops, the
order of march was changed daily, and the legions took turns in leading,
so that each in turn might corne first to camp.

immemorial custom‚ and are still, it is said, common in this region·⁴
Traces of such still exist in England, about 400 years old. - neque
