Carae Durius. - When the van reached the camping-ground selected,
it was immediately formed with front towards the enemy to cover the
work of fortifying. Strong details of cavalry reconnoitred in all direc-
tions, while the engineers immediately set to work at measuring and
staking out the camp. As the legions arrived, they proceeded each to
its allotted place, and laid aside baggage and arms (excepting swords)
in the space behind the site for the tents (arma ier contubernio de·
posita). The cohorts assigned to guard duty of course retained their
anns, and proceeded at once to their posts. Baggage ,and arnis being
laid aside‚ the legions marched to the street next the wall and were
there told off, some for work within the camp, some for fortifying.
The latter work, having already been measured (opere dimenso*), was
begun at once (castra ponuntur, muniuntur l). When the baggage
train arrived, the animals were tethered, each in its proper place, and
'were then unloaded by the servants (calones). 'lhe tents, as a rule,
were only pitched when the fortifications were completed. When not
near the enemy, however, and especially in stormy weather, the tents ’
would be pitched (tabernacula constituere, statuere) immediately on
arrival. As soon as the fortifications were finished, the bulk of the
cavalry was withdrawn into the camp, Α few squadrons were left on

’ picket without (equites ier stationess)‚ and these sent scouts (explora-
= tores§) in all directions. Any special duty of gaining information was

performed by spies (speculatores ΙΙ).

At each gate was usually placed a cohort on guard, the four coming
each from a different legion (cohors in statione ad portam**). ln the
daytime few sentries were posted. But during the night doubtless each
cohort of the guard lined the redan before the gate, and its side of the

i wall, thickly with sentinels. Of course, in special cases the guard was

strengthened. Besides the guards at the gates, one cohort at least was
detailed for duty in the camp, and was stationed in the praetorium and
quaestorium.

As soon as the fortification was completed, the supper was prepared
and eaten. For this meal the staff assembled in the praetorium, and
remained there until nightfall. During this time the general could con·
veniently issue his orders for the night and for the next day. Ar nightfall,
also, the musicians of the army assenrbled to sound the tattoo. This was
the signal for setting the night watch. The cavalry pickets were drawn
into the camp, except a very few single horsemen as outlying sentries
