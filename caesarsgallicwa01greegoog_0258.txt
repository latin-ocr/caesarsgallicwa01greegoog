38 Notes: Ceasar: [B.G

The Gallie sword was very long, two-edged, and sheathed in an iron
seabbard that was suspended at the right side by an iton or bronze chain.
This swerd had no point, and hence was adapted rather sor cutting than
thrusting. ΤΙιε spear had a blade at least 2 ft. long and 6 to 8 in. wide,
sometimes ol an undulated form. As missile weapons, light javelins‚ bows
and slings were used. The helmet was of metal‚ adorned with the horns
of animals, having a erest representing a bird or savage beast, and sur·
mounted by a high and bnshy plume ol feathers. The shield was ol
plank‚ at least 5 ft. long, and very narrow. The body was guarded besides

by an iron or bronze breastplate, or by a eoat ol mail. This last wasa
Gallie invention.

4. agmen claudebant, brought up their rear. The Boii or
Tulingi, with about 15‚ooo men, had been in front of the Helvetian
line of march, and were consequently in the rear when they laced
round to attack Caesar. They now struck at his exposed right ³
flank (latere aperto) as they came on the field from the road
(ex itinere).

16, conversa signa intulerunt, faced about (lit. “bore their l
reversed ensigns upon '' the enemy), and charged in two dzbt'sions.
The divisions stood not baele to back, but. at an angle, facing
outward3 the two front lines facing forward, while the third met the l
flanlr attaek of the neweomers (venantes). The phrase conversa
signa refers only to the movement of the third line, while clitumni
denotes the actiones the entire army. l
