νας-4ο] Second larvasion os Britain. 147

Ammianus (XVI. 12, 43) : “lt began with a low bumming, growing
gradually louder and louder, until it vyas like the thunder of the
uates, when they crash on a rocky shore.'’

107, CnAP. 38. neque noctem neque diem intermittit.
Ambiorix marched only one night aud one day. More than that
would have been expressed by nocturnis diurnisque itineribus
(cl. Bk. Ι. Chap. 38).

2. in Nervios. Caesar had said (Bk. ILChap. 28) that the
Nervii were almost utterly exterminated (propr ad internectonem
redacti) three years before. From this it is inferred that “he
wrote his Commentaries at the time oi the events, and did not
correct them afterwards ’⁹ (long). Or they may have been drawn
up from his despatches to the Senate, which were sent at the close
of each campaign (Roscher). See note on Bk. ll. Chap. 1.

3. oppressam . . . interfici: render by two verbs, to be sur·
promandslaz'n(§292.u.; G. 667. R. 13 H. 549. 5).

Cerne. 40. 2. turrea: these “were open at the sides and behind,
solidly timbered towards the enemy, and their object was, like that
oi the modern bastion, to shorten the length of wall to be occupied
by the defence’' (Moberly). Others think that their use was to
give the soldiers a still higher position from which to throw their
missiles. In this case, is made like those described by Pansa in
Bk. Vlll. Chap. 9, they would have been oi not more than three
stories, or perhaps 30 ft, high. Each story was floored with a
platform, on which the soldiers stood. The lront and sides ol
each platform were protected hya parapet (loricae) oi hurdles,
to the height of about 4 st. Above this projected a sort oi battle-
ment oi stakes (pinuae), oroi hurdles standing erect, with spaces
at intervals, through which the spears were hurled. The structure
was square, os about 10 st. on a side. Of these towers it appears
that on the first night only the iramework was erected. On suc· ’
ceeding nights they were completed.

108, 3. muralium pilorum, long pikeS, to defend the wall.-
cumulantur, floored wilt plaut. Possibly also the towers were
connected by galleries, one for each story.
