sibi, dat. of possession (ξ ²313 G. 349; H. 387); ot egee, the
subj. is the clause iter. . ,facero while the whole passage sibl
. . . liceat, is the object of dicerent. Render, thot they had [it
was to them] in mrhd to male, &c—aliud . . . nullum, like the
English, other passage hod they nones-rogare: oi this verb the
subject is ae. underst00d; and the object is the clause ut . . .
liceat (ξ 331. ας G. 546, and R.1; H. 498. 1); they beggcd it might
he allowed them to do this with his consent.

4. L cassium . . . occisum [esse]‚ object of memoria tene·
bat, as a phrase oi hnowing (ἕ 272. R.¹; G. 527; H. 371. lV.
535.1¹). This defeat happened uc. 107, in the terrible invasion
ol the Cimbri or Teutons‚ the Helvetians being their allies. “The
army of Cassius wasone oi six swept away by these barbarians.”

6, sub iugum [Et. 125] under the yohe (hence the word subju-
gate). The jugum was made by sticking two spears in the ground,
and laying another across them above. To pass under this was
equivalent to loying down arins by a modern army.

concedendum [esse]‚ depending on putabat, impersonal:
thought thot no concessron should be mode, lit. “that it must not be
yielded.”

homines, subj. of temperaturos [esse]‚ depending on existi-
mabat: hejudgod thot mon of hostile temper (abl. of quality, ξ 251 ;
G. 4023 H. 419. ΙΙ.), if the opportunity were gz'oou (abl. absolute)

take timo siquid . . . reverterentur (subj. for imperat. §3393
G. 6553 H. 523. III.): in direct discourse‚ tf you wish anythiug
(said he), return on the 13th os April.

Crine. 8. ea legione, with that legion (abl. of instrum). ln this
sentence, observe how all the qualifying clauses come first, and the
direct objects, murum, fossam, come next before the leading verb
perducit (§ 3433 G. 6763 H. 560); while each relative belongs
to tho verb which comes next after it unless another relative inter·
venes,-a very convenient rule in analyzing a long and difficult
sentence.
