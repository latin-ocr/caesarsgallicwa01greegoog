18 Notes .· Coesar. [Β. G.

commanded the first platoon, and the junior (posterior), the second. The
cohorts and their centurions were graded in rank from the tenth up to
the first. Thus the centurions of the first cohort were of the first rank
(primorum ordinum). The centurions occupied a place about midway
between that of a commissioned officer and that of a non-commissioned
officer in a modern army. They
commanded the maniples‚ and in
battle the first centurion of the first
cohort may almost be said to bave
commanded the legion (but see
note on Chap. 52). On the other
hand, their duties were much like
those of a sergeant. They were
chosen from the ranks for their
experience and skill, and were sel·
dom appointed to a higher position.
The tribuneS‚ together with the offi-
cers in the general staff of the
anny, were usually appointed from
the noble families at Rome through
some political influence.

informed (made more certain).
—- qui dicerent, who were [in-
structed] to say (ξ 3Ῑ7; G. 5443
H. 497. 1.).—sibi . . . liceat:
observe carefully the construc-
tion of the indireet discourse
(ἓ 336. a and ὂς G. 653; H.
523-531) : in direct discourse it
would be, “Nobis est in animo
sine ullo maleficio iter per pro-
vinciam facere, propterea quod
aliud iter habemus nullum3 roga-

mg. 4· Centurio. mus, ut tua voluntate id nobis

facere liceat.'‘ A little atten-

tion to this in the beginning will relieve this construction, very
frequent in Caesar, of all difficulty.
