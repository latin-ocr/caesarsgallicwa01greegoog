the prow with a sharp bearn (rostrum) shod with bronze for striking und
sinking the enemy, and propelled by one or two sails and a multitude of
oar-s. The seamen (nautae) attended to the steering ancl managing of the
soils, and were freemen. The rewers (retinges) were usually slaves. ln
the Mediterranean, galleys were commonly provided with two, three, or
more tieis of oars, and were accordingly called biremes, triremes, etc. It ’
seems probahle, however, that the fleet Caesar had built on the Loire con·
sisted of boats with but one bank of oars, and hence were quite low, and y
decked over only at the bow and stern. The steering apparatus wasa t
couple of broad-bladed oars near the stern, one on each side. The rudiler
was unknown to the Romans. The fighting men on these vessels of
Caesar were legionaries embarked for the purpose. In fact there was no ,

distinct naval service, aswith us. A fleet was simply an army afloat. lt ¹
