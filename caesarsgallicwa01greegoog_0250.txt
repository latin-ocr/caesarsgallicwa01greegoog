notes, or memoranda, and were afterwards copied by hand lor centuries
before their form was fixed by printing. The sentence as it stands is that
given in the best editions ; some of which, however, have perferre, bear,
ior praeferre, prefer. In the above rendering, praestaro has the active
meaning, to surnisb .· and quam the meaning tban, after the comparative
implied in praeferre. This makes the sense clear, but is awkward and
hard. To remedy it, the neatest and best conjecture is to put the pause
after conferant, read debeat for the plural debeant, and perferre for
praeferre, thus: “deterrere ne frumentum conferant; quod praestare
debeat, si jam principatum Galliae obtinere non possint, Gallorum quam
Romanorum imperium perferre.” Here quod is because, and quam iol-
lows the comparative in praestare, taken in the neuter sense of excel: and
the passage reads, from bringing in tbe corn, since it must be better
(praestare debeat) to bear, dac. But there is no manuscript authority lor
debeat. Some would read dicant t'or debeant: since, tbey say, it is bet·
ter, &c.; but this is mere conjecture. Others, again, put salius esse aiter

perferre ; but this is only an explanatory note, written by some early editor, ¹
