fall into the Brenne, and thence into the Seine. Into this peninsula, with
the rivers on each side of him, Vercingetorix had thrown himself with
80,000 men. Alesia as a position was impregnable except to famine.
The water-supply was secure. The position was of extraordinary strength,
The rivers formed natural trenches. Below the town, to the west, they
ran parallel for three miles through an open alluvial plain before they
reached the Brenne. In every other direction rose rocky hills of equal
height with the central plateam, originally perhaps one wide table-land,
through which the water had ploughed out the valley. To attack Ver·
cingetorix where he had placed himself was out of the question; but to
blockade him there, to capture the leader of the insurrection and his
whole army, and so in one blow make an end with it, on a survey of the
situation seemed, not impossible.'' - Fraude's Coesar.

is conjectured that this word does not belong here, being an error
of some copyist, whose eye caught the same word two lines below.

the exterior defences (the fossa and maceria) should rush into the
