3. The column of centuries would naturally be adopted when a cohort
marched directly forward. lf the road was less than 40 ft. wide, as must
often have happened in Gaul,¹¹ the width of the column could easily be
reduced from 40 st. to 20 ft. The right (or left) half os each century would
move straight on, and the other half would fall in its rear. 'l'he century

would then consist oi ιο ranks of 6 men each,
· · instead of 5ranlrs of 12men. This was probably

, the usual formation in a march sorwaid over the
rough Gallie roads.

’ 4. ln column of march, in any formation, we
should estimate 4 ft. as the distance from breast
to breast. Then a cohort of 360 men would reach

. to the following length: —

In column of centuries, 120 or 240 st.;
In column of maniples, 144 or 288 ft.
