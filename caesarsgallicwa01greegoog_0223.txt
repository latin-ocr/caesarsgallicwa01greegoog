THE LEGIONARY.

..ρ-.-

Tfflr core of the Roman army was the legionary infantry. This was com·
posed entirely of Roman citizens ; while the auxiliary infantry, the archers
and slingers, and the cavalry, were os various barbarian nationalities. These
other troops were used for subordinate purposes only. It was intended that
the weight of the battle should be borne by the legions.

'l‘he recruit must be over 17 and under 46 years of age, of sound bodily
health and ot' suitable size. What the limits ol height were in the Roman
army, we do not know* From the fact that the legionary fought with
sword and spear, and not with the breech-loading rifle of modern wars, we
may inser that he must have been more muscular and agile than is now
necessary3 but we cannot inser that he was of unusual size. On the con·
trary, there is little doubt that the soldiers who conquered the world for
Caesar were, as a rule, rather under-sized. The historians always empha-
sized the bigness of the Germans, and Caesar expressly mentions the small
stature of his troops.† The Romans had learned the lesson ol civiliza·
tion, -that victories in war are gained, not by huge bones and big bodies,
but by the trained skill os scientilic organization and taetics. Any one ol
the German giants might perhaps have been more than a match sor any
individual of his puny Italian enemies. But the barbarian mob of Ario·
vistus was shattered when hurled against the spears of the legions.

All the legionaries were clothed, armed and equipped alihe. Next the
skin was worn a sleeveless woollen shirt (runica). Over this was a leathern
coat strengthened by hands of metal across breast and back aud on the
shoulders (lorica). The troops in Trajan’s column are represented with
light-fitting trowsers (braccae) extending below the lmee. lt seems likely,
however, that these did not come into use among the Romans until alter
Caesar’s timess Possibly strips of cloth were worn wound around the
thighs (feminalia) and around the shins (cruralia). The ieet were pro·
tected by sandals (calcei), or by strong shoes not unlike those worn at the
present time. Then, in cold or wet weather, the person was covered by
the military cloak (sagum), a sort of woollen blanket. Of course, this was
laid aside in battle.

The delensive armor consisted of helmet, greaves and shield. The
helmet was either· of iron (cassis), or of leather or cork strengthened with
brass (galea). That of the officer was distinguished by a plume of red or
black featbers (crista). The greaves (ocreae) were of bronze. They were
used to protect the leg below the knee, and were held in place sometimes ι
by straps, sometimes by their own stiffness. Usually but one was worn, on
the right leg, as this was the one advanced in the light. (The greaves may
be seen in the picture of the centurion, Fig. 4.) The sbield (scutum) was

¹² Inlour infantry, no one is received whose height is less than 5 n. 4 in., or more than
δή· balgins, De Germania, l. 4. Caesar, B. G. l. 39; II. 30.
The trowsers in the picture os the legionary (p. 2) are without doubt ol' a later age.
