Hyginus the following arrangement of a cohort of six centuries.

The cohort encamped in a space ol 120 st. iront and 180 st. depth. .
This was divided, on lines parallel to the iront, into 6 portions of 120 ft. by
30 ft. Each portion wassorone century. From the length of the {ronan Ἴ
t't. are to be deducted sor the street dividing the cohort from the adjacent ι
one. That leaves 108 ft. for the tents. Each century had 8 tents: 6 ior ,
the soldiers, one lor the centurion, and one ior the servants. As each tent .
was 10 it. square, the length actually covered by tents would be 80 ft.
This leaves 28 ft. for the 7 intervals between the tentS, or 4 fr. for each
interval. The three first centuries of the three maniples had their tents
iacing the wall, and the three second had theirs facing from the wall.
Thus the two centuries ol one maniple would be stationed back to back.
The second or one maniple would face the first of the next, divided nom
it by a street 12 ft. wide, parallel to the wall.

From the 30 ft. depth of the space allotted to the century, 6 ieet must
be allowed for their hali of the street, 10 st. sor the tents, 5 ft. behind the
latter ior stacking the weaponS, and, finally, 9 feet for the paci< aninals.

Tire several cohorts ol a legion, according to the roonr, could be placed
side by side in a line, or in several lines,
