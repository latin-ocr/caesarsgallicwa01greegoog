BOOK Ι.

inruonucmon: Description of Gaul (Chap 1).

Tua Hauvnrmw With-Orgetorix, an Helvetian chief, plans
the invasion of Gaul: he conspires with the chiefs of several
Gallie tribes; is brought to trial, escapes, and is put under the
ban; soon afterwards dies (2-4). ine Helvetians complete their
preparationS, and gather near the Rhoue, requesting leave to pass
peaceably through the Province. Caesar delays them by pretexts,
while he hastily throws upari earthwork to prevent their crossiog
