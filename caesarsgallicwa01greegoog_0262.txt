The occasion of this new campaign was the following. The AEdui, jealous l
of the Sequani, who lived a little to the north, had laid excessive tolls on
their traiie, which consisted chiefly in the export of salted meats for the y
southern marker* This led to awar, in which the Sequani had invited l
the aid of the Germans under Ariovistus, about three years before the caur- ,
paignofCaesar. The Germans, once in Gaul, had exactedalarge share of l
territory, and proved to be grasping and oppressive masters. Meanwhile l
the Helvetian war began to threaten. The Roman Senate, to make safe, ]
passed the decrees before mentioned, promising favor and friendship to the
AEdui(Chap.11); and at the same time sent messengers to Ariovistus, ,
saluting him as king and friend (Chap. 35), recognizing his claims on Gaul, i
and (ir was said) inviting him to Rome. This was the year before, in
Caesar’s consulship. Now, however, that the fear of the Helvetians was

passed, Caesar found himself obliged to take sides in the old quarrel.
