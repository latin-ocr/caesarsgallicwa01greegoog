2. latitudinem, dcc. Caesar's passage of the Rhine was most
probably at Bonn, where the high and rocky banks begin; or at
Neuwied‚ 20 or 25 miles further south, where there is a break in the .
chain of hills (but here, it is said, the bottom is rach, and not fit for
driving piles). The width of the river at either place is about 1400
feet, its depth is very variable. Itis now crossed in these parts by
floating bridges of boats.

3. rationem. plan. The brief description which Caesar gives of
his rough aud ready but very serviceable engineering may be made
clearer by giving its different points as follows (see F ig. 38) :—

1. A pair of unhewn logs, a foot and a half thick (tigna bina sesquipe-
dalia), braced two feet apart, and sharpened at the end, are driven with
rammers (friatis) into the bottom, sloping a little with the stream ().

2. A similar pair is driven in opposite, 40 feet below, sloping a little
against the stream (⁴): the upper ends of the two pairs would thus be
some 25 or 30 feet apart, the width of the roadway. Riistow thinks that
the 40 feet refer to the top and not to the bottom of the piles.

3. A bearn of square tinrber, two feet thick (trabs bipedalis), and about
30 feet long, is made fast at the ends by ties (fibulis) between the logs of
each pair,- which are thus kept at a proper distance apart, while they are
strongly braced against the current ( )

4 A suitable number (probably about 60) of these trestles, or timber·
arches, having been built arrd connected by crass-ties,— this part of the
structure must he taken for granted—planks are then laid lengthwise of
the bridge (directa rmrterr'a), restiug ou the heavy door-timbcrs; and upon
these, again, saplings and twigs (lorrgurir', crates) are spread, to prevent
the jar and wear of the carts and hoofs ol the pach-animals on the
flooring t ).

5. Piles (sublicae) are then driven in below, testing obliquely against
the logs, to which they serve as shores or bultresses (pro ariete), and
other heavier piles a little way above, to break the force of floatiug logs or
boats sent dovvn to destroy the bridge ( ).

tigna, probably unhewn logs.—bina‚ two and troo, ie. in pairs.
*pedum duorum, ie. between the timbers of each pair.
