20. ln estimating the time needed sor sortiiying the camp, we may
consider the normal measure of the ditch to be 9 lt. wide and 7 ft.
deep. Some os the men were detailed to the ditch, rome to the wall,
and others to guther material and make fascines. Those allotted to
the ditch would probably worh in three reficis, each being occupied not
more than an hour. A skillsnl digger who worhs only one hour andis
then relieved, can easily excavate in that time from 50 to 60 cu. it.
(Roman). But the Roman legionaries were above all things skillful at
digging. Then 3 or 4 hours would suffice completely to sortify the camp.
Meanwhile others would be busied in laying out the streets and setting
up the tents. So is the work was begun at noon, by 4 o’clock all would

be finished.
