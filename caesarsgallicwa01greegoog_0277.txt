The Roman camp was measured with great precision by certain
lixed rules (based on the science of augury), and thoroughly forti·
fied with earth-wall, ditch and palisades The spade was as familiar
to the Roman soldier as the sword or javelin. ln this case, Caesar
had one larger camp about two miles north of the Germans and

. a smaller one rather more than half a mile to the west of them.

1. The Roman army in hostile or doubtful territory encamped at the close
of each day’s march on ground carefully selected and as carefully fortified.
When possible, the site was the slope of a gentle hill, so that the front had
before it still a portion of the descent, and the rear lay on the summit.
Thus line of battle could be formed before the camp in the favorite
Roman position (in loco superiore *). Tben‚ too, water must be at hand,
and abundant wood. Of course these conditions could not always be ful·

filled, and sometimes the camp must be pitched where necessity demanded
(in loco necessario).

2. The right-angled quadrilateral was in Caesar's time probably the only
form of the Roman camp (Fig. 15). It was either square, or with sides
in the ratio of 3 to 2. The corners were rounded, so as to afford room
for defense. The gates (portae), one on each side, were usually merely
openings, probably as wide as the front of amaniple (40 ft). They
were defended by semi-circular tanrlrours, or by a traverse (titulum)
reaching to a corresponding distance (see Fig. 15). Very likely on the
inside was a corresponding traverse.

3. The normal Roman fortification consisted of a wall (agger, vallum) on
which the defenders placed themselves † ; and before it a ditch (fossa), from
which carne most of the material for the wall, and which stopped the
approach of the enemy at the distance of a good spearcast. The width of
the ditch at the top was always a number divisible by 31, and the depth was
hof this width‚ plus 1. We may notice that Caesar usually gives hutone
dimension of the ditch, the other, of course, being understood. The usual ·
width was 9 ft, and the depth was 7 ft. There were three forms: that
with both scarp and cortnterscarp1sloping (sorra frastigatal3 the sassa

both scarp (latus interius) and counterscarp (latus arterias) vertical
