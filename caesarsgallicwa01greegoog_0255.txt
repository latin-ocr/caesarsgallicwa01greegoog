'Ihm Ounnrt or Barna—The favorite position os the Romans, the
locus superior, was a hillside, not too steep, with the enemy below. The
line of battle was formed across the slope, and here the Romans awaited

or other obstacle likely to confuse the hostile ranks, it was so much the
mum.

In the triple order oi battle, the first line contained sour cohorts, and
each of the others contained three (see Fig. 28). Between each cohort
and the next one in the same line was left an
interval equal in extent to the iront ol a 2, numnam&
cohort. Behind these intervals in the first nnnnuunnnnnrr

been (on an average) about 120 it. in extent,

As the 3 maniples of a cohort were placed side by side, the front os
each would occupy 40 ft. Allowing 4 lt. t'or the interval between the
maniples, in which interval stood the centurions, and 3 tt. room sor each
man, the maniple would consist ot 12 files. The distance from breast to
breast in the files was quite likely 4 it. Thus the file would contaiu 10
men, and the maniple would form a square of 40 st. on a side. The first
5 ranks formed the first ordo (or century), and the remainder were the

When the enemy had reached the right distance, the bugle sounded the
charge, and the legions rushed down hill to meet them, sword in sheath,
and the first two ranks with spears uplisted (pilis infistis) ready to hurl.
