v. 12-19.] Second Invasiorv of Britain'. 143

Bk. Ι. Chap. rto—per medios, i.e. through the interval between
the two cohorte.

Crine. 16⁸. cedentibus et insequentibus, agreeing with ete
understood (abl. abs.)‚ referring to the Britons. Whether ad·
vancing or retreating‚ the islanders were equally formidable.

4. stationes, supporta. lt will be observed that the Britons
showed considerable military skill, and that their mode of battle
somewhat resembled that of the Romans themselves. They used
an open and flexible array, ra'ther than the dense masses (phalan-
ges) of the Gauls and Germans.

97, Cune.18. uno loco: somewhere between Brentt'ord and
the mouth of the Wey. The details of Caesar's march are here
uncertain: as Mr. Long thinks, he went by the passage of the
Mola through the chalk hills at Dorking.

a. sudibus: these defenceS, or palisades, have been thought to
be indicated by the local name Cowey Stabat, near the junction of
the Wey with the Thames. These, however, were at right angles

κ with the bank, as if piles sora bridge3 while those spoken of in

the text were' driven in along the bank-one of the rows at low
water.

4. eapite solo, a most hazardous depth. By the rule t'or modern
infantry, a ford should not be more than three feet deep. But, says
Merivale, “the swimming and fording of rivers were among the
ἵ regular exercises of the Ronran legionary. Though immersed up
J to his chin in water, he was expertiri plying his hatchet against
the stakes which opposed his progress, while he held his buckler
over his head not less steadily than on dry land. Behind him
a constant storrn ol stones and darts was impelled against the
enemy from the engines which always accompanied the Roman
armies.”

Crine. 19. locisque impeditis ao silvestribus: from this

J description we must infer that the British chariots were very narrow,

³ to pass through the forest roads; and had very high wheels, to go

easily over rough ground.

ἵ a. cum...eiecerat. See note ou Bk. 111. Chap. 9, “The
Conjunction 0um,” ΙΙ. c. 1.
