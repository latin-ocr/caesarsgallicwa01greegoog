Tun MILITARY STANDARDS. -The term signa (signa militaria), in
a general sense, applied to all the standards of the army. That of the
legion was an eagle (aquila), usually of
silver‚ about the size of a dove, and
carried on the top of a wooden staff.
The staff was shod with iron so that it
might be thrust into the ground. Often
it was adorned with a vexillum, a little
flag, or banner, suspended from a cross-
bar at the top. The vexillum was red or ·
white, and was inscribed with the num-
ber or name of the legion. The eagle
was intrusted to the first cohort, and espe-
cially to the care of its oldest centurion.
Its bearer (aquilifer) was a soldier se-
lected for his courage and fidelity.

The standard of the cohort was the mg. 8· Aquila·
signum, in the narrower sense of that word. It was usually the figure of
an animal —a wolf or sheep, for instance —on a staff. Its bearet was the
sigmfir. Vexilla were also carried on the flanks of the maniples to mark
the alignment, performing the same office as “guidons ’' in a modern bat-
talion. Thus there must have been at least four vexilla in a cohort,—
perhaps eight, if each century re- r ι
quired them for its alignment. [1⁴ ’YQ

The cavalry and light troops and
all separate detachments (see Bk.

VI. Chap. 36) carried only the
vexillum. Its bearet was called

 

vexillarius. There was another
standard called vexillum, the flag
of the general. This was a large
banner, white, with an inscription F 18*- 1⁰·

in the camp, and when displayed was the signal for march or battle (see
